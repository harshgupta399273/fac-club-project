# Portfolio and Risk Management

This repository contains my Winter Project for IIT Kanpur's FAC Club (2025).  
The project focuses on understanding and implementing core concepts in quantitative finance, portfolio construction, and risk management.

## ?? Objective
Build a foundational understanding of portfolio theory, asset allocation, risk modelling, and basic quant techniques such as Monte Carlo simulations, Fama-French factors, and Black-Litterman models.

## ?? Weekly Breakdown

### **WEEK 0 — Setup & Fundamentals**
- Python basics (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Understanding Git & GitHub workflow
- Repo structure setup

### **WEEK 1 — Foundations of Finance & Algo Trading**
- What is Algorithmic Trading?
- Basics of investing  
- Time value of money  
- Risk vs return  
- Financial markets & asset classes  
- Portfolio diversification  
- Introduction to risk  

### **WEEK 2 — Portfolio Theory & Risk Metrics**
- Asset Allocation Strategies  
- Modern Portfolio Theory (Markowitz)  
- Standard deviation, beta, Value at Risk (VaR)  
- Maximum drawdown  
- Risk-adjusted performance metrics:  
  - Sharpe  
  - Sortino  
  - Treynor  

### **WEEK 3 — Advanced Risk Management**
- Hedging strategies (futures, options)  
- Portfolio stress testing  
- Scenario analysis  
- Probabilistic random walk  
- Monte Carlo simulations  
- Intro to Fama-French & Black-Litterman models  

### **WEEK 4 — Implementation Phase**
- Monte Carlo simulation for portfolio returns  
- Risk modelling  
- Fama-French factor model  
- Black-Litterman portfolio optimization (if time permits)
